This book is pretty well-known for presenting important modeling and prediction techniques. Topics like linear regression, classification, resampling methods, tree-based methods, clustering, and more are covered in such an approachable way that even I'm able to understand what's going on :)

This book is available free on the authors' [website]({{page.website}}) as a PDF or, for the phsysically-inclined, on [Amazon]({{site.amazon}}) for $$. There are a ton of resources for working through ISL, including: 

- a nifty [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL06ytJZ4Ak1rXmlvxTyAdOEfiVEzH00IK), 
- a [course lecture video list](https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/) by ISL's authors, and 
- a separate course that used ISL with [videos and slides](http://www.alsharif.info/iom530).
