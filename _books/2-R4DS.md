Not on my physical bookshelf \*yet\* but *R for Data Science* is a great, approachable read for an introduction to data science using R. The book covers a *wide* variety of data science tasks that have natural approaches using R. It covers a great deal of practical data science, including:

- exploratory data analysis (tidying, transforming, modeling, visualizing) and its workflow,

- data wrangling with the tidyverse,

- modeling data for understanding datasets of variable complexity, and most importantly

- communicating your analysis results to others.

The [print book]({{page.amazon}}) is sure to be pretty dang good, but the [online book]({{page.website}}) is constantly updated through pull requests, which beats (a) learning something that's incorrect from a print book and (b) checking the errata for your particular mistake.
