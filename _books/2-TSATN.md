*The Signal and the Noise* is a fantastic inter-disciplinary book that finds statistics in science, economics, and prediction. It's filled with incredibly interesting analyses, offers insight into a leading statistician's intuition, and is one of the most approachable reads on Bayesian statistics I've yet found.

This book isn't heavy on statistics, and is actually a great casual read for anyone quantitatively-minded or interested in prediction. I *highly* recommend a [physical copy]({{page.amazon}}) to litter with notes --- it's worth it.
