This ebook is pretty cheap (read: **free** on both [EasyPub (PDF)]({{page.website}}) and on the [eBook](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/)) and offers a great insight into how to approach datasets through an exploratory lens. The book covers both practical and principle when it comes to exploring a dataset, including:

- building and understanding the principle behind exploratory graphs

- plotting in R (base, ggplot2)

- EDA techniques like dimensionality reduction and clustering

I found it particularly useful for building that EDA state of mind and closing that gap between getting a new dataset and becoming more familiar with its contents/properties/quirks.
