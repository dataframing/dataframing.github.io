description: I share a list of books on data science and machine learning that are on my bookshelf!

**Hi!** My name is Danny Vilela. You can find out more [about me](/me), but otherwise this is my (online) bookshelf. Digital bookshelves are nice in that they aren't bound to *just* books â€“ they can also hold online courses and other resources that I tend to appreciate as I learn more about data science!

Most of these books have an online/free equivalent, but I also provide a link to the Amazon listing if you're like me and need a physical book sometimes. For each listing I'll do my best to include a more in-depth review of each, along with any other resources I found useful in covering that resource.

Have a great read, \\
Danny
