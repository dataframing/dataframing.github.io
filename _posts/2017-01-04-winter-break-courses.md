It's the beginning of the winter break. "Breaks", however, don't apply to people (read: *me*) who somewhat-foolishly enroll into more online courses than they know what to do with. As such, this post is an online commitment to my completion of the following courses on Udemy this month. In approximate order of precendence:

  1. [The Complete SQL Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/): I'm pretty well-versed in SQL from my time during the fall at Aloha, but this course is in Postgres and I couldn't resist.

  2. [Big Data with Spark and Python](https://www.udemy.com/taming-big-data-with-apache-spark-hands-on/): My first taste of Spark! I can taste the hype behind the buzzwords.

  3. [Big Data with Spark and Scala](https://www.udemy.com/apache-spark-with-scala-hands-on-with-big-data/): Similar to the preivous course, but more JVM. Doubling-down on Spark.

  4. [Scala and Spark for Big Data and Machine Learning](https://www.udemy.com/scala-and-spark-for-big-data-and-machine-learning/): Somewhat cringy title, but it's a double-down on Scala and a triple-down on Spark.

  5. [Big Data with Spark Streaming and Scala](https://www.udemy.com/taming-big-data-with-spark-streaming-hands-on/): No, your eyes are not deceiving you. This is a different course than #3 and #4. More cementing on Scala and Spark.

  6. [R with SparkR](https://www.udemy.com/supercharge-r-with-sparkr/): "But Danny", you ask, "is there no such thing as too much Spark?" I pause. I ponder my life's decisions -- is there a limit to #BigData? "No," I reply, "there is not."

  7. [Automating Data Exploration with R](https://www.udemy.com/automating-data-exploration-with-r/): I have my reasons for wanting to improve my exploratory data analysis skills, most of them related to my looking for an internship.

To be fair, Udemy courses are relatively short and the dedicated student can go through one per day or two. To that end, consider me a moderately dedicated student. A good number of these courses are for cementing what I already know about data analysis and expanding my toolset, which is actually pretty exciting!

I'll update this post or dedicate separate posts to my review of these courses. Be on the lookout!
