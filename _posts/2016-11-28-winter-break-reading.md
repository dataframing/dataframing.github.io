*Books.* There are too many on my wishlist, and the bookworm's dilemma hasn't forgotten me: there are more books that I'd like to read than I could ever have time for.

Fortunately, I've made a plan of (reading) action for this winter break that I'll pin up to this somewhat-desolate blog as a reminder to myself. They are as follow:

1. **R Programming for Data Science** by *Roger D. Peng*: I picked this one off of Leanpub.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis with R** by *Roger D. Peng*: Another Leanpub pick.

3. **Statistical Inference for Data Science** by *Brian Caffo*: Yet Another Leanpub Pick!

You might notice that this list happens to contain data-centric books â€“ and you'd be correct! My free time this break is almost entirely being devoted to working on my exploratory data analysis skills, including the initial exploration, deep-diving, visualization, and communication. It'll make more sense once [Exploratorium](https://github.com/dataframing/exploratorium) picks up some steam :)

This list is by no means exhaustive, but it's a good start. It'll likely be effected by my willingness to complete the many micro-courses I've signed up for.
