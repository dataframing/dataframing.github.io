Hi! My name is Danny Vilela. I'm a junior at New York University who's passionate about using data to solve a wide variety of problems.

# In 250 characters or less: tell me about yourself.
I love using data to solve new, multidisciplinary problems and tell compelling stories. I've danced with data at [Basecamp](https://m.signalvnoise.com/twelve-weeks-basecamp-a-summer-tale-b6c181fa925#.2zgbq3evp) and currently [Aloha](https://aloha.com/). In my free time, I like [reading](/bookshelf), learning new programming languages, and petting other peoples' dogs.

# What tools do you use?
Python for general-purpose programming and machine learning (pandas, scikit-learn), R for more exploratory data analysis (dplyr, data.table) or visualization (ggplot2, shiny), and different flavors of SQL (My/Postgres) for database querying. I'm always expanding my toolset, and right now I have my eyes on Scala (Spark, etc.) and Julia for data science.

# How can I contact you?
For a quick overview, I've got my [resume](http://bit.ly/dataframing-resume) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dataframing). Check out more of my code on my [blog](/) or [GitHub](https://www.github.com/dataframing). Feel free to reach out via email at [danny.vilela@nyu.edu](javascript: void(0)), but you can also send me your thoughts and prayers over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dataframing)!
