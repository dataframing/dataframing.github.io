Hi! My name is Danny Vilela. I'm a junior at New York University who's passionate about using data to solve a wide range of problems. 

As a self-proclaimed data scientist, I like looking at data, doing some exploratory analysis, and communicating any important insights. As a person, I like reading books, learning nifty languages on my own, and discovering new music. I feed on data and stuff.

# How can I contact you?
Feel free to reach out via email at <a href=".">danny.vilela@nyu.edu</a>, connect on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/dataframing">Linkedin</a>, or check out my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx2xS-V7rItVS25jZHBqb3doVnc/view?usp=sharing">resume</a>. You can also send me your thoughts and prayers over on <a href="https://twitter.com/dataframing">Twitter</a>!

# What do you do?
I like taking a data-driven approach to problem-solving and product insights. This blog is a public portfolio for some of the work I contribute for a few courses I take at <a href = "http://cds.nyu.edu/">NYU's Center for Data Science</a> and on my own <a href="https://github.com/dataframing">GitHub</a>.

# What tools do you use?
Python for general-purpose programming and some data analysis, R for inolved data analysis (dplyr) or visualization (ggplot2), and MySQL or PostgreSQL for database querying. I'm always expanding my toolset, and right now I have my eyes on Scala (Spark, etc.) and Julia for data science.
