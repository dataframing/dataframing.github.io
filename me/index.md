Hi! My name is Danny Vilela. I'm a junior at New York University who's passionate about using data to solve a wide range of problems. 

As a self-proclaimed data scientist, I like looking at data, doing some exploratory analysis, and communicating any important insights. As a person, I like reading books, learning nifty languages on my own, and discovering new music.

# How can I contact you?
Feel free to reach out via email at [danny.vilela@nyu.edu](#), connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dataframing), or check out my [resume](http://bit.ly/dataframing-resume). You can also send me your thoughts and prayers over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dataframing)!

# What do you do?
I like taking a data-driven approach to problem solving and product insights. This blog is a public portfolio for some of the work I contribute for a few courses I take at [NYU's Center for Data Science](http://cds.nyu.edu/) and on my own [GitHub](https://github.com/dataframing).

# What tools do you use?
Python for general-purpose programming and some data analysis, R for inolved data analysis (dplyr, tidyverse) or visualization (ggplot2, ggvis, shiny), and different flavors of SQL (My/Postgres) for database querying. I'm always expanding my toolset, and right now I have my eyes on Scala (Spark, etc.) and Julia for data science.
